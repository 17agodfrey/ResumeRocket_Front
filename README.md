## Project Summary

ResumeRocket is a web application focused on providing a collection of tools and services to improve the professional online presence and utility of its users.

## Project Description

We plan to provide a web application that will allow a user to maintain a professional resume. We will provide functionality to automatically adapt the resume to job listings provided by a user. We want to also provide portfolio functionality where a user can link to/display projects that theyâ€™ve worked on. This web application will dynamically provide a user with an up to date printable copy of the resume; customized and tracked with version control so that a user can watch the progress of the resume over time. We anticipate the main user group of this application will be students and any professional job seekers. We intend the builder to be usable by any career field; not just Engineering students. We will also add functionality to automatically take the customized resume and apply to a job listing provided by a user.
